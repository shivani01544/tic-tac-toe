# tic-tac-toe

Tic Tac Toe is a classic strategy game where you can play against the computer.
This interactive game features a modern UI with **Light & Dark mode**,
multiple AI difficulty levels (**Easy, Medium, Hard**), and **score tracking**.
The backend (Node.js + JSON file) is used to **store scores and game state persistently**, 
while the game logic and AI are handled on the frontend. 
The objective is to align three of your symbols (X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal.
